Required Optimizations:
- Align all structs properly, order does matter, 4 byte alignment
- Support alignent in memory blocks as well, 4 byte alignment by default

Editor:
- Adding and removing tiles (Tiles must be stored sparsely, hashed by index, Fast to iterate over)
	* Ideas: Just use arrays and a index table with just pointers to tiles
- Loading and saving a tilemap with only used tiles to disk

UI:
- Simple text drawing using STB_truetype

Debug:
- Add performance measurement block timing mechnism
