Notes:
- Alignment:
	The vc++ compiler fully aligns all structs automatically.
	There is a "Struct Member Alignment" in the C++ Compiler-Settings.

	This should be enabled sometimes to ensure that contiguous used structs are aligned properly -> See: StaticAlignmentAssert

	B32 is simple a bool, forced to be 4 byte instead of 1 byte to ensure alignment.

	To force alignment for a structure to a specific boundary use:
	#pragma pack(1 or 2 or 4 or 8) and #pragma pack(0) around the struct.

- We use a lot C++ features: Change the compiler to C only and remove unnecessary features, like operator overloading, const etc.

Optimizations:
- Support alignent in memory blocks as well, 4 byte alignment by default

Editor:
	- Simple ui for selecting brush operations (Add, Remove)
	- Flood fill (Selectable in UI)
	- Multiple but fixed tile types (Selectable in UI)
	- Multiple but fixed layers (Selectable in UI)
	- Tileset image loading and datasets

Game:
	- Smooth transition for in-game camera
	- Rendering of tiles from a tileset image
	- Loading and saving a tilemap with only used tiles to disk

Renderer:
- Simple text drawing using STB_truetype

Debug:
	- Add performance measurement block timing mechnism
	- Render debug text
	- Draw performance measurement blocks in a useful way
