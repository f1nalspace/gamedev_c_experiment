Notes:
- Alignment:
	The vc++ compiler fully aligns all structs automatically.
	There is a "Struct Member Alignment" in the C++ Compiler-Settings.

	This should be enabled sometimes to ensure that contigous used structs are aligned properly -> See: StaticAlignmentAssert

	B32 is simple a bool, forced to be 4 byte instead of 1 byte to ensure alignment.

	To force alignment for a structure to a specific boundary use:
	#pragma pack(1 or 2 or 4 or 8) and #pragma pack(0) around the struct.

Required Optimizations:
- Support alignent in memory blocks as well, 4 byte alignment by default

Editor:
- Loading and saving a tilemap with only used tiles to disk

UI:
- Simple text drawing using STB_truetype

Debug:
- Add performance measurement block timing mechnism
